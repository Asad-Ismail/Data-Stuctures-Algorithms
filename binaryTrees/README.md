Traversals:

In-Order: "Left, Root, Right" - Like reading English, from left to right.
Pre-Order: "Root, Left, Right" - The root comes before its children.
Post-Order: "Left, Right, Root" - The root comes after its children.
Max Depth: Think of it as the longest path from root to a leaf. It's the height of the tree.

Symmetry: Use the concept of a mirror. If a tree is symmetric, its left and right sub-trees should be mirror images.

Path Sum: You're essentially traversing down the tree while keeping track of the sum.
