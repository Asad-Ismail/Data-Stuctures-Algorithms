A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure, also known as a Union-Find data structure or simply Disjoint Sets, is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set of elements into disjoint, non-overlapping subsets. It is mainly used to solve problems where you need to perform operations such as merging two sets or checking if two elements belong to the same set efficiently.

The DSU data structure consists of two primary operations:

Union: This operation combines two disjoint sets into a single set.
Find: This operation determines which set an element belongs to, by returning a representative element of that set, often called the "parent" or "leader" of the set.
In order to implement a DSU, we typically use an array or a dictionary to store the parent of each element. Initially, all elements are in their own set, and their parent is themselves. When we perform a union operation, we update the parent of one set's leader to be the leader of the other set. The find operation follows the parent pointers until it reaches an element that is its own parent, which is the leader of the set.

There are two common optimizations used to make the DSU more efficient:

Path Compression: During the find operation, after finding the leader of a set, we update the parent of every element visited along the path to point directly to the leader. This helps to flatten the tree structure and speeds up future find operations.

Union by Rank/Size: When performing a union, we choose the new leader based on the rank or size of the sets, i.e., we attach the smaller set to the larger set, which helps to keep the tree's height smaller, resulting in faster find operations.

These optimizations enable the DSU data structure to perform union and find operations in nearly constant time (amortized O(alpha(n)), where alpha(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is extremely slow-growing and can be treated as a constant for practical purposes).
